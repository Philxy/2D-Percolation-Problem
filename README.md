# 2D-Percolation-Problem
Implementation of the two dimensional quadratic lattice percolation problem.

Given a two dimensional quadratic lattice in which each vertex is occupied with a statistically independent probability p. 
At a critical threshhold, large and long ranging clusters of connected vertices begin to appear.

This code generates such a lattice and determines the largest cluster. The threshold appears at approximately p=0.7 which theory suggests.
